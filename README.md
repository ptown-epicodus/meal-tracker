* I want to log a food I have eaten by submitting a form with food name, calories and details.
* I want to view a list of foods I have logged.
* I want options to view all foods, only high-calorie foods (more than 500 calories), or only lower-calorie foods (less than 500 calories).
* I want to click a food to edit its name, details or calories (in case I decide to pretend my fries were 100 calories instead of 365).
